### Patch Changes

- 6ad01d4: Fix OpenCode approval notifications silently dropping. Verified against a real `opencode` 1.18.1 event stream, the approval-request event is **`permission.asked`** (payload `{id, sessionID, permission, patterns, metadata, always, tool}`) — the type discriminator lives in `properties.permission` (e.g. `"bash"`/`"edit"`). An earlier SST-era SDK exposed **`permission.updated`** with a `type` field; the current Anomaly build no longer emits it (§21.1 harness drift).

  The adapter still forwarded and mapped the removed `permission.updated` name, so `permission.asked` was never forwarded and **every `approval_required` notification was dropped** — OpenCode users got no "the agent is waiting for you to approve" beep, one of the most important signals for a mobile notification app.

  The plugin now forwards `permission.asked`, and the normalizer maps it to `approval_required` reading the type from `properties.permission`. `permission.replied` is still dropped (the user's own reply, not an agent-attention moment), and the raw command (`patterns` / `metadata.command`) is never persisted — only the safe `permission_type` discriminator flows through. Verified end-to-end against the real `opencode` binary: a live session with `permission.bash = "ask"` now delivers `approval_required` to the ingest sink.

- 71d46d6: Security: close a Windows command-resolution hijack that could lead to silent RCE.

  The OpenCode plugin's event delivery spawned the bare name `birdybeep` with `shell: true`
  and no `cwd`, and every adapter's `detect()` probed the harness with a bare-name `execFile`
  (`codex`/`claude`/`opencode --version`). On Windows both `cmd.exe` and libuv resolve a bare
  name against the CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY before PATH (applying PATHEXT), and these run with
  the harness's cwd = the repo the developer just opened. A hostile repo shipping
  `birdybeep.exe`/`.cmd`/`.bat` (or `codex.exe`, …) at its root could therefore get arbitrary
  code execution the moment a lifecycle event fired or `birdybeep agent install`/`doctor` ran —
  no prompt.

  Delivery and detection now resolve the target to an ABSOLUTE path via a new `agent-core`
  helper (`resolveOnPath`/`safeSpawn`/`safeExecFile`) that searches PATH only — never the cwd —
  and launch that absolute path with a trusted cwd and `windowsHide`. A Windows `.cmd`/`.bat`
  shim (which Node refuses to spawn without a shell) is run through the shell with the
  fully-qualified quoted path, so no cwd-first resolution can occur. If the CLI isn't on PATH
  the event is dropped with a one-time breadcrumb instead of falling back to a bare-name spawn.
  POSIX behavior is unchanged (its PATH search never included the cwd).

  On Windows the resolver now tries the real PATHEXT extensions (`.CMD`/`.EXE`/`.BAT`/…) and no
  longer prefers an extensionless PATH match. A standard `npm i -g` co-locates an extensionless
  `birdybeep` (a `#!/bin/sh` wrapper) with `birdybeep.cmd` in the same on-PATH directory;
  resolving the sh wrapper made it spawn without a shell, which Windows CreateProcess can't
  launch — silently dropping every OpenCode event and degrading version detection to "unknown".
  Picking the `.cmd` restores delivery on the exact platform this fix targets. On POSIX the
  resolver is now `execvp`-aware: a present-but-non-executable file earlier on PATH is skipped
  so the search continues to the real executable instead of failing with EACCES.

  The OpenCode plugin also delivers its event envelope on the CLI's STDIN reliably on Windows:
  piping the payload to a `.cmd` through `cmd.exe` did not dependably reach the batch shim's
  `node` grandchild (the bytes and their EOF were lost, dropping every event), so for a Windows
  `.cmd`/`.bat` the payload is now written to a strict-perm temp file and the shell's stdin is
  redirected from it (`… < "file"`), deleted when the child exits. POSIX and a Windows `.exe`
  still pipe straight to stdin. The CLI's "read stdin to EOF" contract is unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- 11b72f2: Add the `repository` field (with monorepo `directory`) to every published package.json, pointing at the public GitHub repo. Required for npm provenance and Trusted Publishing (OIDC) to validate the publishing repository, and it makes the "Repository" link on npmjs.com work.
- 8a385a5: Publish the agent-core and adapter packages (`@birdybeep/agent-core`, `@birdybeep/claude-code`, `@birdybeep/codex`, `@birdybeep/opencode`) to npm alongside the CLI. They are the CLI's runtime dependencies, so they now ship as public packages in the same fixed-version release.
