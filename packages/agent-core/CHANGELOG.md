### Patch Changes

- 11b72f2: Add the `repository` field (with monorepo `directory`) to every published package.json, pointing at the public GitHub repo. Required for npm provenance and Trusted Publishing (OIDC) to validate the publishing repository, and it makes the "Repository" link on npmjs.com work.
- 8a385a5: Publish the agent-core and adapter packages (`@birdybeep/agent-core`, `@birdybeep/claude-code`, `@birdybeep/codex`, `@birdybeep/opencode`) to npm alongside the CLI. They are the CLI's runtime dependencies, so they now ship as public packages in the same fixed-version release.
