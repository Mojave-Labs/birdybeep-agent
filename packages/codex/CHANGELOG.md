## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- f2b9827: Register Codex's `[[hooks.Stop]]` for turn-complete and stop writing the single-slot `notify`
  program. `notify` is a scalar any tool can claim, so BirdyBeep's installer used to overwrite
  whatever was there — destroying other tools' Codex integrations. Install is now
  non-destructive: a foreign `notify` is left in place and reported, and uninstall never touches
  a value that is not ours. Backups are no longer written once-and-only-once, so no overwrite is
  unrecoverable.

  If the slot still holds BirdyBeep's own older value, install now hands it back to the program
  that value displaced — read from the backup taken at the time — instead of just clearing it, so
  upgrading repairs an integration a previous version broke.

  Turn-complete now arrives via the append-only, trust-gated hooks array, carrying `session_id`,
  `turn_id` and `model` — strictly more than `notify` provided.

  Existing users must re-run Codex's `/hooks` to trust the new `Stop` entry.

### Patch Changes

- 4b31d09: Give the Claude Code, Codex and OpenCode malformed-config doctor checks the same actionable
  fix line Cursor got in birdybeep-agent-tu1 (birdybeep-agent-8kt).

  `birdybeep doctor` told users to "Fix or remove the malformed settings.json / config.toml /
  opencode.json, then re-run install" — naming neither the file nor the command, for the one
  failure `birdybeep agent install` cannot repair by itself (every installer parses before it
  writes, so a corrupt config makes it throw rather than heal). All three now print the real
  recovery, branching on whether the installer actually left a backup:

  - backup present → "Restore the BirdyBeep backup at `<config>.birdybeep-backup` over `<config>`
    (or delete the malformed file), then run `birdybeep agent install <harness>`."
  - no backup → "Fix the JSON/TOML in `<config>` (or delete it), then run
    `birdybeep agent install <harness>`."

  Verified per adapter by inducing the corrupt-config failure in a temp `HOME` with the built
  CLI, following the printed remedy, and confirming `doctor` comes back green — in both the
  backup and the no-backup branch. The unit tests now assert the concrete path + install command
  and are branch-discriminating (`not.toContain("birdybeep-backup")` on the no-backup branch —
  the backup string is a superstring of the config path, so without it a stuck ternary stayed
  green); the same assertion was backfilled into Cursor's test. `docs/troubleshooting.md`'s
  malformed-config block now shows both shapes and is consistent across all four adapters.

- bbdbab7: Claude Code events now also report the session name as a discrete `metadata.session_name`
  field, so the BirdyBeep app can offer "lead my push titles with the session name" as a phone-side
  preference instead of the adapter deciding the title format on your behalf. Previously the name
  was only ever baked into the title string, which the server cannot take apart.

  Nothing changes in what you see today: the adapter still leads its own title with the name, so
  the default (pass-through) title format is byte-identical. Sessions you have not named send no
  such field, and a server that doesn't read it simply ignores it — no wire-schema change, the
  field rides the existing open `metadata` object.

  The name is the one Claude Code puts on the `SessionStart` payload — set with `claude --name`, or a
  `/rename` from an earlier session. A mid-session `/rename` is not replayed to hooks, so it applies
  from the next session (unchanged from sv1, which leads the title with the same value).

  Privacy is unchanged in kind: `session_name` is a name YOU typed, never a session id and never
  path-derived, and it goes through the same redact → hash-paths → truncate pipeline as the title it
  mirrors, so a path or token typed into a session name is scrubbed in both places. Secrets are now
  redacted BEFORE the adapter's 120-char cap is applied: capping first could split a token below the
  length its pattern needs to match, leaving a readable prefix on the wire (a latent sv1 defect on the
  title path, fixed here for both surfaces).

  Codex, Cursor and OpenCode send no session name: the first two expose only opaque ids, and
  OpenCode's session `title` is generated from the conversation rather than typed by the user, so
  forwarding it would push prompt content off the machine. Each adapter's source now records that
  audit result, and `docs/security.md` documents the new field.

  Verified live end to end by `scripts/live-e2e-session-name.mjs` (new): the real built CLI fires
  real Claude Code hooks into the product worker running under `wrangler dev`, and the push the
  worker puts on the wire is composed from the field the real adapter sent.

- 120d1ee: Fix a false "installed"/"trusted" Codex status (security: trust-signal correctness). The trust
  marker that flips Codex from `needs_trust` to `installed` was recorded on **any** mappable, non-
  skipped event — including the top-level `notify` program (`agent-turn-complete`), which Codex runs
  on every turn regardless of whether the user ever trusted the `[[hooks.X]]` entries via `/hooks`.
  So the first turn-complete flipped BirdyBeep to `installed`, claiming approval beeps worked, while
  the security-relevant `PermissionRequest` → `approval_required` lifecycle hook was still untrusted
  and silently dropped — a false "you'll be notified" promise.

  Trust is now recorded only when a genuinely **trust-gated lifecycle hook** (a payload keyed by
  `hook_event_name`) is processed with a `delivered` or `queued` outcome. A `notify` fire, a `skipped`
  (unmappable) payload, or a `dropped` (terminally rejected) event no longer flips the marker, so
  Codex keeps reporting `needs_trust` until a real hook fire proves the hooks were trusted. The
  `doctor` "Codex hooks trusted" detail now explains that turn-complete beeps arrive via the ungated
  `notify` program and are not proof of trust.

- 71d46d6: Security: close a Windows command-resolution hijack that could lead to silent RCE.

  The OpenCode plugin's event delivery spawned the bare name `birdybeep` with `shell: true`
  and no `cwd`, and every adapter's `detect()` probed the harness with a bare-name `execFile`
  (`codex`/`claude`/`opencode --version`). On Windows both `cmd.exe` and libuv resolve a bare
  name against the CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY before PATH (applying PATHEXT), and these run with
  the harness's cwd = the repo the developer just opened. A hostile repo shipping
  `birdybeep.exe`/`.cmd`/`.bat` (or `codex.exe`, …) at its root could therefore get arbitrary
  code execution the moment a lifecycle event fired or `birdybeep agent install`/`doctor` ran —
  no prompt.

  Delivery and detection now resolve the target to an ABSOLUTE path via a new `agent-core`
  helper (`resolveOnPath`/`safeSpawn`/`safeExecFile`) that searches PATH only — never the cwd —
  and launch that absolute path with a trusted cwd and `windowsHide`. A Windows `.cmd`/`.bat`
  shim (which Node refuses to spawn without a shell) is run through the shell with the
  fully-qualified quoted path, so no cwd-first resolution can occur. If the CLI isn't on PATH
  the event is dropped with a one-time breadcrumb instead of falling back to a bare-name spawn.
  POSIX behavior is unchanged (its PATH search never included the cwd).

  On Windows the resolver now tries the real PATHEXT extensions (`.CMD`/`.EXE`/`.BAT`/…) and no
  longer prefers an extensionless PATH match. A standard `npm i -g` co-locates an extensionless
  `birdybeep` (a `#!/bin/sh` wrapper) with `birdybeep.cmd` in the same on-PATH directory;
  resolving the sh wrapper made it spawn without a shell, which Windows CreateProcess can't
  launch — silently dropping every OpenCode event and degrading version detection to "unknown".
  Picking the `.cmd` restores delivery on the exact platform this fix targets. On POSIX the
  resolver is now `execvp`-aware: a present-but-non-executable file earlier on PATH is skipped
  so the search continues to the real executable instead of failing with EACCES.

  The OpenCode plugin also delivers its event envelope on the CLI's STDIN reliably on Windows:
  piping the payload to a `.cmd` through `cmd.exe` did not dependably reach the batch shim's
  `node` grandchild (the bytes and their EOF were lost, dropping every event), so for a Windows
  `.cmd`/`.bat` the payload is now written to a strict-perm temp file and the shell's stdin is
  redirected from it (`… < "file"`), deleted when the child exits. POSIX and a Windows `.exe`
  still pipe straight to stdin. The CLI's "read stdin to EOF" contract is unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- 11b72f2: Add the `repository` field (with monorepo `directory`) to every published package.json, pointing at the public GitHub repo. Required for npm provenance and Trusted Publishing (OIDC) to validate the publishing repository, and it makes the "Repository" link on npmjs.com work.
- 8a385a5: Publish the agent-core and adapter packages (`@birdybeep/agent-core`, `@birdybeep/claude-code`, `@birdybeep/codex`, `@birdybeep/opencode`) to npm alongside the CLI. They are the CLI's runtime dependencies, so they now ship as public packages in the same fixed-version release.
