### Patch Changes

- 120d1ee: Fix a false "installed"/"trusted" Codex status (security: trust-signal correctness). The trust
  marker that flips Codex from `needs_trust` to `installed` was recorded on **any** mappable, non-
  skipped event — including the top-level `notify` program (`agent-turn-complete`), which Codex runs
  on every turn regardless of whether the user ever trusted the `[[hooks.X]]` entries via `/hooks`.
  So the first turn-complete flipped BirdyBeep to `installed`, claiming approval beeps worked, while
  the security-relevant `PermissionRequest` → `approval_required` lifecycle hook was still untrusted
  and silently dropped — a false "you'll be notified" promise.

  Trust is now recorded only when a genuinely **trust-gated lifecycle hook** (a payload keyed by
  `hook_event_name`) is processed with a `delivered` or `queued` outcome. A `notify` fire, a `skipped`
  (unmappable) payload, or a `dropped` (terminally rejected) event no longer flips the marker, so
  Codex keeps reporting `needs_trust` until a real hook fire proves the hooks were trusted. The
  `doctor` "Codex hooks trusted" detail now explains that turn-complete beeps arrive via the ungated
  `notify` program and are not proof of trust.

- 71d46d6: Security: close a Windows command-resolution hijack that could lead to silent RCE.

  The OpenCode plugin's event delivery spawned the bare name `birdybeep` with `shell: true`
  and no `cwd`, and every adapter's `detect()` probed the harness with a bare-name `execFile`
  (`codex`/`claude`/`opencode --version`). On Windows both `cmd.exe` and libuv resolve a bare
  name against the CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY before PATH (applying PATHEXT), and these run with
  the harness's cwd = the repo the developer just opened. A hostile repo shipping
  `birdybeep.exe`/`.cmd`/`.bat` (or `codex.exe`, …) at its root could therefore get arbitrary
  code execution the moment a lifecycle event fired or `birdybeep agent install`/`doctor` ran —
  no prompt.

  Delivery and detection now resolve the target to an ABSOLUTE path via a new `agent-core`
  helper (`resolveOnPath`/`safeSpawn`/`safeExecFile`) that searches PATH only — never the cwd —
  and launch that absolute path with a trusted cwd and `windowsHide`. A Windows `.cmd`/`.bat`
  shim (which Node refuses to spawn without a shell) is run through the shell with the
  fully-qualified quoted path, so no cwd-first resolution can occur. If the CLI isn't on PATH
  the event is dropped with a one-time breadcrumb instead of falling back to a bare-name spawn.
  POSIX behavior is unchanged (its PATH search never included the cwd).

  On Windows the resolver now tries the real PATHEXT extensions (`.CMD`/`.EXE`/`.BAT`/…) and no
  longer prefers an extensionless PATH match. A standard `npm i -g` co-locates an extensionless
  `birdybeep` (a `#!/bin/sh` wrapper) with `birdybeep.cmd` in the same on-PATH directory;
  resolving the sh wrapper made it spawn without a shell, which Windows CreateProcess can't
  launch — silently dropping every OpenCode event and degrading version detection to "unknown".
  Picking the `.cmd` restores delivery on the exact platform this fix targets. On POSIX the
  resolver is now `execvp`-aware: a present-but-non-executable file earlier on PATH is skipped
  so the search continues to the real executable instead of failing with EACCES.

  The OpenCode plugin also delivers its event envelope on the CLI's STDIN reliably on Windows:
  piping the payload to a `.cmd` through `cmd.exe` did not dependably reach the batch shim's
  `node` grandchild (the bytes and their EOF were lost, dropping every event), so for a Windows
  `.cmd`/`.bat` the payload is now written to a strict-perm temp file and the shell's stdin is
  redirected from it (`… < "file"`), deleted when the child exits. POSIX and a Windows `.exe`
  still pipe straight to stdin. The CLI's "read stdin to EOF" contract is unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- 11b72f2: Add the `repository` field (with monorepo `directory`) to every published package.json, pointing at the public GitHub repo. Required for npm provenance and Trusted Publishing (OIDC) to validate the publishing repository, and it makes the "Repository" link on npmjs.com work.
- 8a385a5: Publish the agent-core and adapter packages (`@birdybeep/agent-core`, `@birdybeep/claude-code`, `@birdybeep/codex`, `@birdybeep/opencode`) to npm alongside the CLI. They are the CLI's runtime dependencies, so they now ship as public packages in the same fixed-version release.
