Claude Code notifications now say which session fired and what it did. The push title leads with `repo · branch` (pure-filesystem git detection, worktree- and detached-HEAD-aware, fail-soft), and the completion body is the summarized `last_assistant_message` instead of a fixed "Turn complete". Adds `detectRepoContext` to agent-core and populates `workspace.repo_name`/`branch` on events; no wire-schema change.
